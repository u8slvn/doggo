**Doggo** is a basic dog AI developed in Python and using pygame as a rendering engine. The dog just walks around the screen, changing states and direction randomly and dog's fur color is also picked randomly at start. State changes are based on a [Markov chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain), which is a simple model to represent a sequence of possible events in which the probability of each event depends only on the state attained in the previous event.

Here is a list of the dog states: *idle*, *idle and bark*, *walk*, *walk and bark*, *sit*, *sit and bark*, *lie down*, *lie down and bark*., *run*, *run and bark*, *stand*, *stand and bark*, *sleep*.

**Project context**: A colleague of mine wanted to have a dog, but he couldn't because of lots of reasons. So I decided to make him a virtual dog and it was the opportunity for me to play with Markov chains.

## Controls

The project is designed as a simple pet widget to keep on your desktop. It's an always-on-top borderless window, so you need to click on it to get the focus before interacting with it.

* `ESC` to quit.
* `Left Click` to move the window around.

## Install and run

Make sure you have Python 3.12 installed on your machine. **Doggo** use [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to manage dependencies and virtual environment, so you need to install it too. Then, you can run the following commands at the root of the project:

```bash
poetry install
poetry run python -m doggo
```

## Build locally

If you want to build the project locally, you can use the script in `scripts/build.py`. It uses [PyInstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/) under the hood. Don't hesitate to update the script to fit your needs.

```bash
# Available os options: windows, linux, macos
poetry run python scripts/build.py --os <os>
```

The script will generate a `dist` folder at the root of the project with the executable inside.

## Development

For now, only one biome (mountain) is available. The feature to pick a biome randomly at start is already implemented, so I wish to add more in the future. Otherwise, I don't plan to add more features, like weathers or interactions, but the project is open to contributions. Just open a discussion before to make sure your idea fits the project.
